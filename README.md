#Applications of Machine Learning in Quantum Mechanics. 

#Abstract

#Computational models that combine quantum mechanics (QM) with machine learning (ML) principles promise to deliver accurate 
#as possible information about a quantum system at high speeds. These two fields are related to each other by linear algebra, 
#and it is imperative we examine the redundancy in solving Schrödinger’s equations throughout different types of potential 
#situations: step, piecewise linear and random Fourier series. This project uses TensorFlow to initially generate 1-D potentials 
#and then solve them using a gradient descent method. These potentials and their respective solutions are partitioned into sets 
#of training data and test data. The training data is inputted into a simple neural network with two hidden layers. The mean 
#square distance between the “correct” solutions and the output of the neural network is the cost function and the gradient 
#descent on the network “solves” the problem.
